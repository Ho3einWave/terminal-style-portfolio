# Building a Terminal-Inspired Portfolio

In this post, I'll walk through how I created this terminal-inspired portfolio website using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This unique design stands out from typical portfolios while showcasing both coding skills and personality.

## Why a Terminal Theme?

As developers, we spend countless hours in the terminal. It's a familiar interface that represents our daily work environment. A terminal-themed portfolio immediately communicates:

1. You're comfortable with command-line tools
2. You appreciate minimalist, functional design
3. You have a bit of personality and don't just use standard templates

## Key Components

### ASCII Art

ASCII art adds character and visual interest without heavy graphics:

```typescript
console.log("Hello, world!");
```
