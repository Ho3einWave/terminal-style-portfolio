date: 2023-01-01
description: Brief description of the post
---

Your content here in Markdown...
```

### Styling

The project uses TailwindCSS for styling. You can customize the theme in `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      // Customize your color palette
    },
    // Add other theme customizations
  }
}
```

### Components

Most UI components are in the `components/` directory. You can modify or extend them to suit your needs.

## Adding or Removing Sections

The main layout is in `app/page.tsx`. Each section is a Card component in the bento grid. You can:

1. Add new sections by creating a new Card component
2. Remove sections by deleting the respective Card components
3. Rearrange sections by changing their position in the grid
